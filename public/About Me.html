<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! I'm Ericson, a passionate individual with a compelling life story. 
  Growing up as a newspaper vendor's child, I developed a strong 
  determination to overcome life's challenges. My love for gadgets 
  and technology has been a constant source of inspiration, 
  driving me to excel in my academic and professional endeavors.
</p>

<p> In pursuit of my dreams, I financed myself by working and 
  securing two full academic scholarships. Balancing my responsibilities as 
  a call center agent while studying proved to be an invaluable experience, 
  teaching me the importance of "time" and perseverance.
</p>

<p>Upon graduating as Cum Laude of Bachelor of Science in Information
   Technology, I felt a sense of immense pride and accomplishment. 
   This degree has opened doors to various opportunities, and I am 
   now fortunate enough to work as an IT Instructor, sharing my
  knowledge and passion for technology with others. Additionally, 
  I contribute to the digital world as a Content Moderator, ensuring 
  that online spaces remain safe and responsible.
</p>

<p>In my free time, I continue to explore new technologies and gadgets,
   fueling my passion for innovation. I believe that every challenge 
   presents an opportunity for growth, and I strive to make a positive
    impact in the lives of those around me. Thank you for taking the 
    time to learn a bit about my journey, and I look forward to 
    connecting with you!
